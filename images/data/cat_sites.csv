Shillourokambos ,34.7496,33.1177,"Shillourokambos, Cyprus","The site of Shillourokambos holds the earliest evidence of a commensal relationship between cats and humans. French archaeologists working at Shillourokambos uncovered a deliberate burial of Felis lybica adjacent to a human burial. Researchers indicate that this correlation in burials is perhaps the earliest known evidence of a ‘pet cat’ in the archaeological record. Most of our earliest and most famous history of cat domestication comes from ancient Egypt, but Shillourokambos lends a quiet hint that the domestication process may have occurred much earlier than originally theorized, predating the Egyptians by approximately 4,000 years.

Klimonas,34.7125,33.1337,"Klimonas, Cyprus","Klimonas is the earliest known Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) site in Europe with similar evidence of early dog and cat domestication. Researchers from the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle, and the University of Toulouse II-Le Mirail who directed the excavations at Klimonas have argued the date of the site to be between 11,000 to 10,400 BP. Stone tools, weapons, and buildings were found at Klimonas including evidence of wild boar hunting and early cultivation of a primitive wheat brought from the mainland. The findings at Klimonas provide evidence of sea-faring capabilities as well as participation in mobile, complex economic systems. ",images/klimonas.jpg,,"9,000 - 8,400 BCE","2",
Quanhucun,35.3939,109.188,"Quanhucun, Shaanxi Province, China","The Chinese village of Quanhucun exhibits evidence of just how widespread cat domestication had become well before their immortalization on reliefs in ancient Egypt. No doubt, the domestic cat’s utility in catching mice and rats in granaries provided farmers with much-needed help in preventing their harvest’s destruction. Yaowu Hu and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed cat bones recovered at Quanhucun and found that there was no DNA evidence linking the cat species found there to the descendants of the Near Eastern Wildcat. In other words, it is likely that the inhabitants of Quanhucan participated in a commensal relationship with a wildcat species native to the local area.

Umm El Qa'ab ,26.1766,31.9081,"Tomb T (of Pharaoh Den) at The Umm El Qa'ab Necropolis, Abydos, Egypt",Flinders Petrie’s team who uncovered Den’s tomb at Umm El Qa’ab discovered 17 mummified cat skeletons at the site as well as small pots adjacent to them. These pots were likely filled with milk and offered to the cats buried there to enjoy in the afterlife. The burial of cats with their human counterparts was a popular funerary practice in ancient Egypt. The notion that one could be joined with one’s pet in the afterlife was a common practice among many ancient Egyptians. ,images/UmmelQaab.jpg,,"2,970 BCE","8",
Baqet III,27.9338,30.8836,"Tomb of Baqet III, Beni Hasan, Egypt","The burial tomb of Baqet III exhibits beautiful murals that adorn the inner shrine and catacomb. Murals depict everything from daily life hunting animals, artisans working, Nubian bowmen, and multiple wrestling scenes depicting certain techniques and positions. A painting of a cat hunting a rat was also found on the threshold mural above Baqet III’s inner tomb wall. By the Middle Kingdom, amulets with cat heads were becoming fashionable jewelry pieces and gave the adorner protection in life as well as the afterlife. ",images/baqetiii.jpg,,"2,100 BCE","9",
Bubastis,30.5727,31.51,"City of Bubastis, Egypt","Bubastis or Tell-Basta in Arabic was a notable center for worshipping the goddess, Bastet who was a principal deity of the nome, a territorial division of ancient Egypt in the Lower Nile Valley. The city became a royal residence for some of the last rulers of Egypt prior to the close of the New Kingdom demarcated by the Achaemenid conquest. Bubastis was known for the veneration of Bastet and was also found to be the largest depository of mummified cat corpses in ancient Egypt. Bastet had gained so much popularity during the New Kingdom that a feast, a festival, and oracle were made popular in her honor.  ",images/bubastis.jpg,,943 BCE,"10",
Speos Artemidos ,27.899,30.8666,"Speos Artemidos (Grotto of Artemis), Istabl Antar, Egypt","Two temples stand at the Grotto of Artemis along the central portion of the Nile River Valley. One portion, dedicated to Seti, is adorned with decorations, while a second, later temple was attributed to Hatshepsut. It is here where Hatshepsut constructed a temple dedicated to Pakhet, another Egyptian cat goddess that was a combination of Bast and Sekhmet. Archaeologists at the site uncovered large catacombs of mummified cats where Egyptians who worshipped Pakhet would come to bury their beloved pets. Although Egyptians would often bury their cats here, Bubastis was the predominant hub of this funerary practice. ",images/Speos_Atermidos.jpg,,"1,458 BCE","9",
Athens,37.9891,23.7322,"Relief of Kouros Statue, Athens, Greece","    This relief from a kouros statue found in Athens depicts two men sitting seated opposite of each other. The figure on the left has a leashed canine that seems to be traumatizing some sort of feline leashed by its owner on the right. This is one of an extremely rare few depictions of felines in ancient Greece. However, the evidence we do have suggests that cats had made it to the mainland of Greece and Rome by at least the 6th century BCE.  ",images/kourosRelief.jpg,,510 - 500 BCE,"11",
Pompeii ,40.7514,14.485,"House of Faun, Pompeii, Italy","Deemed one of the largest private residences at Pompeii, the House of Faun revealed many wondrous pieces of artwork from the Samnite Period around 180 BCE. The residence underwent many natural disasters including evidence of rebuilt walls from the great earthquake in 62 CE as well as the famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Pompeii is famous for its pristine artworks including mosaics and figurines, as well as well-preserved buildings and other artifacts. The preservation of these is largely due to the multiple layers of ash, completely inundating these items for over 2 millennia. 
     One of the mosaics uncovered depicts a cat planning its hunt underneath a bird bath presumably somewhere in the city. ",images/HouseofFaunCat200BCE.jpg,,200 BCE,"13",
"Northumberland, England",55.1666,-2,"Northumbria, Ireland","By 800 CE, the first depictions of a cat in Christian literature was found in the Book of Kells along the margins of the Lindisfarne Gospels in Northumbria, Ireland. The image depicts a cat stepping on the tail of one of two mice fighting over a communion wafer. ",images/northUmbriaCat.jpg,,800 CE,"17",
"Dzhankent, Kazakhstan",45.55,61.8666,"Dzhankent, Kazakhstan","The early medieval city of Dzhankent adjacent to the Aral Sea intersects the northern Silk Road route linking the large trade city of Khorezm in the south to small intermittent trading settlements in the Volga as well as the 10 c. CE capital of Oghuz. By the arrival of Islam in the 8th c. CE, Felis catus was establishing itself as a common pet among sedentary pastoralists in the region. Dzhankent is an interesting example of how cat-keeping was a varied practice among different cultural lifestyles (i.e. sedentary vs. nomadic).
 Hegemony over Dzhankent at this time was administered by the Oghuz people, originating in the Central Asian Steppe who largely participated in a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle.  Oghuz elites likely oversaw trade practices in the city as it was strategically located on the northern route of the Silk Road. Dzhankent challenges the notion that pet-keeping was fundamentally a sedentary pastoralist practice. The Felis catus remains found at Dzhankent suggest that the people living there retained a different attitude about pet-animals than previous steppe populations. Additionally, the domestic cat remains unearthed by archaeologists at Dzhankent provide the earliest known evidence of the cats in the region on the Silk Road. The globalization taking place along the Silk Road at the time also suggests that worldviews and attitude between nomadic and urban lifestyles were rapidly changing.
