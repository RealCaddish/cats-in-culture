        "Description": "The site of Shillourokambos holds the earliest evidence of a commensal relationship between cats and humans. French archaeologists working at Shillourokambos uncovered a deliberate burial of Felis lybica adjacent to a human burial. Researchers indicate that this correlation in burials is perhaps the earliest known evidence of a ‘pet cat’ in the archaeological record. Most of our earliest and most famous history of cat domestication comes from ancient Egypt, but Shillourokambos lends a quiet hint that the domestication process may have occurred much earlier than originally theorized, predating the Egyptians by approximately 4,000 years.

Researchers from the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle, and the University of Toulouse II-Le Mirail who directed the excavations at Klimonas have argued the date of the site to be between 11,000 to 10,400 BP. Stone tools, weapons, and buildings were found at Klimonas including evidence of wild boar hunting and early cultivation of a primitive wheat brought from the mainland. The findings at Klimonas provide evidence of sea-faring capabilities as well as participation in mobile, complex economic systems. ",

No doubt, the domestic cat’s utility in catching mice and rats in granaries provided farmers with much-needed help in preventing their harvest’s destruction. Yaowu Hu and his colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed cat bones recovered at Quanhucun and found that there was no DNA evidence linking the cat species found there to the descendants of the Near Eastern Wildcat. In other words, it is likely that the inhabitants of Quanhucan participated in a commensal relationship with a wildcat species native to the local area. ",

Bubastis was known for the veneration of Bastet and was also found to be the largest depository of mummified cat corpses in ancient Egypt. Bastet had gained so much popularity during the New Kingdom that a feast, a festival, and oracle were made popular in her honor.  ",

Archaeologists at the site uncovered large catacombs of mummified cats where Egyptians who worshipped Pakhet would come to bury their beloved pets. Although Egyptians would often bury their cats here, Bubastis was the predominant hub of this funerary practice. ",

        "Description": "The early medieval city of Dzhankent adjacent to the Aral Sea intersects the northern Silk Road route linking the large trade city of Khorezm in the south to small intermittent trading settlements in the Volga as well as the 10 c. CE capital of Oghuz. By the arrival of Islam in the 8th c. CE, Felis catus was establishing itself as a common pet among sedentary pastoralists in the region. Dzhankent is an interesting example of how cat-keeping was a varied practice among different cultural lifestyles (i.e. sedentary vs. nomadic).\n Hegemony over Dzhankent at this time was administered by the Oghuz people, originating in the Central Asian Steppe who largely participated in a nomadic pastoralist lifestyle.  Oghuz elites likely oversaw trade practices in the city as it was strategically located on the northern route of the Silk Road. Dzhankent challenges the notion that pet-keeping was fundamentally a sedentary pastoralist practice. The Felis catus remains found at Dzhankent suggest that the people living there retained a different attitude about pet-animals than previous steppe populations. Additionally, the domestic cat remains unearthed by archaeologists at Dzhankent provide the earliest known evidence of the cats in the region on the Silk Road. The globalization taking place along the Silk Road at the time also suggests that worldviews and attitude between nomadic and urban lifestyles were rapidly changing.   ",
