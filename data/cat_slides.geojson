        "Description": "<p> Welcome, cat enthusiast. This application intends to journey you through the wild world of our favorite feline friend.The domestic housecat, known as <i>Felis catus</i>, exhibits a complex and gradual history of evolution distinct from any other domesticated species. If you’ve ever heard the phrase, <i>“like taming a herd of cats,”</i> you’ll recognize the irony in the idea that cats can somehow bend to our will—unlike the nature of other ‘domestic’ animals such as dogs, sheep, or goats. People are often confused about whether cats truly are ‘domestic’ or ‘tame.’ <br> <br> <img src=images/catDrawing.jpg alt=Cat Drawing; class=center>  <img_txt class=center>Drawing from the <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=cat+drawing&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image> Wikimedia Commons</a></img_txt>  <p> </img_txt>  This distinction is an important one that will be a central theme throughout our historical journey. If a young ‘wild’ species of any animal is captured at a young age, humans retain the ability to give care and therefore ‘tame’ it into a mostly-trusted, modified companion. A ‘domestic’ animal, in contrast, is one in which genetic change has occurred over time throughout an entire population as humans artificially selected individuals to be more tolerant and adapted to living with them. \n  <img src=images/caddishinbox.jpg alt= Caddish in a box class=center> <img_txt class=center> Caddish, my (mostly) trusted companion and major fan of compact boxes</img_Txt> <i> <p>Felis catus</i> is no exception to this process. However, because cats often put on airs of superiority and possess a natural self-aggrandizing attitude, we’re often confused if we control the cat or if the cat controls us. Who is domesticating who? Is this animal tame or domesticated? To answer these questions more fully, let’s take a journey back in time to <i>Felis catus’ </i> verified wild progenitor, the African wildcat (<i>Felis lybica</i>). <p>Before we go further, please use the map to your advantage. Occasionally, you'll find an orange dot, <img src=images/archsitedot.JPG alt= arch site dot>, which denotes the location of an archaeological site related to cats.

Controversial taxonomic literature about the precise ancestral progenitor to Felis catus perplexed geneticists for decades. However, in 2007, a  team of genetic researchers published a <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5612713/> highly-praised genetic assessment </a> of 979 domestic and wild cats in a September issue of the journal, Science. Their analysis revealed that domestic cats from Europe, the Near East, and Asia, all derive from one of two genetic subtypes of <i>Felis lybica</i>—one from Turkey, the other from Egypt. <img src=images/felisLybica.jpg alt=Felis lybica class=center> <img_txt class=center> Photograph of an African wildcat (i.e. <i>Felis lybica</i>) </img_txt> <p>Scholars are still unsure whether these populations became domesticated separately and later interbred, or if one became domesticated and later interbred with another population.

Let’s move on to a cultural history of this development from <i>Felis lybica</i> to <i>Felis catus</i> by means of humanity’s artificial selection. ",

        "Description": "<p>The story of human involvement with the earliest felids begins in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent> Fertile Crescent</a>, a region demarcated by modern countries spanning regions of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, and fringe areas of Turkey and Iran. The region of the Fertile Crescent is widely attributed to the earliest evidence of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution> Neolithic farming settlements</a> (circa 9,000 BCE) that began to dot the various river valleys such as the Tigris and Euphrates in the north, as well as a large portion of the Nile River valley to the south. Farmers in the Fertile Crescent particularly focused on cereals, legumes such as peas and lentils, as well as animal husbandry with sheep, pigs, goats, and cattle. \n\n   <p>  The region is often referred to as one of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_of_civilization> ‘cradles of civilization,’</a> because a shift from mobile, hunter-gatherer societies to sedentary, agrarian ones became a defining mechanism of Homo sapiens’ earliest forms of societal and technological advancements. <img src=images/fertileCrescent.jpg alt=The Fertile Crescent Image class=center>  <img_txt class=center> Illustration of the Fertile Crescent by Stefano Bianchetti in <a href=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fertile-crescent/>National Geographic's Encyclopedia</a></img_txt> <p> By the 3rd Millennium BCE, the advent of agriculture in the region brought about developments in irrigation, writing, the wheel, and glass, as well as new cultural phenomena such as libraries, forms of organized law, and construction activities. \n   Farmers soon realized that a positive aspect to their practice resulted in food surpluses. In short order, farmers constructed granaries to store their produce and they soon became a major characteristic of farming villages throughout the region.  \n\n <br> <p> As farming reshaped Homo sapiens’ social behaviors and practices, so too did it reshape those of the local wildlife. By the end of harvest season when granaries were filled, rodents and insects soon wrought havoc on the newfound bounty. Fortunately, the farmers overseeing granaries soon realized that cats (particularly <i>Felis lybica</i>) were particularly useful in controlling these varmint and insect populations, and naturally participated in a mutually beneficial relationship. Here, we have the earliest forms of cat ‘taming’ in which local populations of <i>Felis lybica</i> lived alongside humans where they could enjoy tasty mammalian treats while humans rested easy knowing their granaries weren’t overrun with destructive and invasive species. \n",

But the earliest historic evidence of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt during the Old Kingdom lends itself to the earliest forms of cultural appreciation for the cat as a domestic partner through various artworks and religious context. \n",

Our earliest evidence of the Greeks with <i>Felis catus</i> comes from two coins depicting Iokasto and Phalanthos playing with their pet cats. \nEven though cats were being introduced to Greece and Italy at this time, they remained quite rare as house pets compared to the Egyptians. <br> <img src=images/Greekcatanddogfight.jpg_large alt= Greeks with their animals class=center> <img_txt class=center> Above, the statue base from Athens depicts a dog and a feline about to fight (circa 510-500 BCE)  </img_txt> <p>Weasels, not cats, were far more common as ‘rodent-regulators,’ and the lack of reverence for them in the Greek word ailouros (thing with the wavy tail) exemplifies as such.

Weasels seem to have not taken to domestication as well as cats did, and therefore, they were soon replaced by their felid friends. Regardless, the cat never achieved the sort of cultic appeal they had in Egypt and textual and artistic renderings of them remained sparse. \n",

        "Description": "<p>Much like their Greek predecessors, ancient Romans also remained apathetic about the cat and its role in society and few artworks or literary pieces of the cat’s existence remain. The sparse data we do have about domestic cats from the period is typically overshadowed by Romans’ fascination with ‘big cats’ that were often killed for sport at the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum> Roman Colosseum </a> or for their elegant hides used for fashionable clothing. Nevertheless, cats and weasels remained primary rodent hunters around Roman granaries, but neither achieved the deified status the former enjoyed in Egypt. \n <br><p>From a traditional Roman story about the dedication of the temple of the goddess <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertas> Libertas </a> at Mount Aventine, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus> Tiberius Gracchus </a>? is said to have placed a cat at her feet. Libertas, wearing a white robe with a scepter in one hand and a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygian_cap> Phrygian cap </a> in the other, accepted the offering and the Temple was duly blessed. Libertas and the Phrygian cap are both symbolic of freedom and independence. The relationship between freedom and the Phrygian cap was a later construct created during the American and French Revolutions. The original <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(hat)> pileus</a> is thought to have originated by the ancient Illyrians but regardless, was quite popular at the time. <br><img src=images/pileus.jpg alt= Pileus cap class=center> <img_txt class=center> Above, a man sports a pileus which was popular among  ancient Greeks and Romans.<br> </img_txt> <p>   Traditionally, a velvet pileus was worn by liberated Roman slaves and, as such, the cat at the feet of Libertas signified this freedom. \nDespite this literary evidence, cats were perhaps less popular in Rome than their Greek predecessors. <i>Felis catus’</i> character traits of disobedience, individualism, and disloyalty were not necessarily the same traits admired by Roman citizens. Additionally, domestic cats were not nearly as glorious, mighty, or heroic as other animals that Romans admired and chose to depict in their artworks and literature. <img src=images/catinRome.jpg alt= Cat mosaic from Rome class=center> <img_txt class=center> A mosaic of a cat confidently catching a bird. </img_txt> <p>Romans later honored the cat, however, with the phrase “Libertas sine Labore” which translates as “Liberty without labor,” a description of how cats achieved freedom by doing nothing at all.

First, if a judge didn’t prosecute a religious crime, he would be deemed guilty of the heresy as well.

        "Description": "<p> The dissolution of the Roman Empire by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths> Goths </a> was one aspect of incredible geopolitical changes taking place in Europe and North Africa. Although Christianity was dominating Paganism by this time, the rise of Islam created a power competition spanning central Asia to western Europe. The continued demonization of Pagan goddesses brought with it a distrust of cats as well. \n     A fundamental theological difference between Pagans and Christians influenced this attitude towards cats. According to the Pagan theology, all creatures had spirits or what we commonly today consider souls. During the Dark Ages, the common Christian belief, on the other hand, was that these souls were evil or devoid of God. This created the foundational difference between the opposing belief systems (i.e. monotheism vs. polytheism, nature vs. man, man vs. woman). <br> <img src= images/catsandblackdeath.jpg alt= Cats in Black Death class=center> <img_txt class=center> Cats removing rats and bird. </img_txt>  \n   <p>  As this religious competition permeated throughout the geopolitical landscape, the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian> Plague of Justinian </a> brought death and increased distrust among Christians towards Pagans. Scholars estimate that roughly <a href=https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/244/1/3/5532056?redirectedFrom=fulltext> 5,000 people died per day between 541 – 547 CE </a>, resulting in close to 60% of the total European population. As the Plague of Justinian wrought havoc on the population, Christians soon tied Pagans to God’s anger and, with them, cats as culprits too. The nature goddesses of Isis, Diana, Freya, and Artemis, were just a handful of pagan cults deemed heretical by the organized Christian church. Cats, were therefore quickly linked to their heretical followers and were demonized by the Christian church in short order. The rise of early Christianity was inextricably linked to the confirmation of a patriarchal society, valuing dominance, and hunter psychologies over matriarchal societies that valued goddesses associated with farming, fertility, and independence. <img src=images/catsMiddleAges.jpg alt= Cat in Middle Ages class=center>  <p>The patriarchy of the established church brought with it submissive attitudes and roles towards women as well as a continued campaign against all non-conforming to Church doctrine as heresies. This shift in religious and cultural psychology paved the way for cats to be demonized in much of Christian Europe during the Dark Ages. \n    Regardless, cats still dotted the Christian landscape. For instance, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_I> Pope Gregory I </a> was described as always having a cat in his lap and, by 640 CE, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_of_Nivelles> St. Gertrude of Nivelles </a> was known for her love of cats too. As plagues became commonplace among Europe, vermin were slowly beginning to be recognized as the culprit of disease that wrought havoc on European societies and cats were a perfect solution to the problem. Slowly, cats were becoming disassociated with the Pagan cults that were so inextricably linked to them and began to prance their way into the care of Christian households. \n",

As the Catholic Church became the primary civil and criminal court body, witchcraft and magic was well on its way to being identified and codified in order to find and persecute detractors.\nOpinions of cats during the Middle Ages went from gentle to harsh as people desperately attempted to explain the worsening situation in Europe at the time.

Three years later, the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum> Malleus Maleficarum </a> was published, explaining how a) women were more likely than men to be witches, b) how to conduct investigations into witchcraft, and c) how to legally proceed with the courts to try these cases. <br> <img src=images/CatAndWitchcraft.jpg alt=Cats and Witchcraft class=center> <img_txt class=center>Two Witches with a Cat, by Jacob de Gheyn II (1600). </img_txt><p> \nDistrust of women became commonplace in the Church, primarily due to an interpretation of the Biblical Genesis story suggesting women were defective because they were created from Adam’s rib as well as causing the ‘temptation of man.’ Other Biblical passages also fueled these anti-women viewpoints, and the Catholic church was quick to link them and their cats to heresy. Clearly, men within the church feared women throughout the Middle Ages as heretical detractors; edicts from the Pope as well as publications issued from the Catholic Church provide a window into this viewpoint. <br> <img src=images/CatandWitchcraft2.jpg alt=Cats and witchcraft 2 class=center><img_txt class=center> Hallowe'en, by Raphael Tuck and Sons (circ 1908).</img_txt> <p> \nThe link between cats and magic was nothing new by 1272 CE. Evidence of cats related to magic has been found as early as the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. Black cats were considered important because their blood mixed with particular herbs was believed to be extremely effective in warding off disease, as well as casting powerful incantations. \nBy the end of the Middle Ages, corrupt women and cats had fallen from graced goddesses to be celebrated into feared symbols of magic, heresy, and devil-worship. However, these cultural attitudes would once again change—but the cat would never again achieve the goddess worship it once enjoyed. \n",

However, despite the continued utility of cats as vermin-controllers, cats retained many of the same associations with witchcraft that they had in Europe. Many trials of witchcraft and heresy took place in the New World, similar to those in Europe. The most famous in North America were the infamous <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials> Salem Witch Trials </a> in which 20 women were found guilty and executed for their participation in witchcraft. Many of these trials continued for more than 400 years, well into the 20th c. CE. In 1867 another witchcraft trial took place accusing a woman of practicing witchcraft because she used the blood of a black cat to cure a child. ",

European settlers arriving in Australia likely brought these felines with them and in short order, were making themselves comfortable on the continent. ",

        "Description": "<p> There is little question that the journey of cats from the granaries of the Fertile Crescent into our living rooms is one of complexity and hardship. Attitudes towards cats changed often between culture and time. At times, cats were worshipped for their positive qualities while at others they were distrusted and villified for their negative qualities. The tapestry of events between cat and human is long and stitched with caveats and exceptions. Humans incessantly tried their hands at taming other wild cat species, but never reached the bar of domestication set by the progenitor, <i> Felis lybica.</i> <img src=images/caddishandme.jpg alt=Caddish and Me class=center> <img_txt class=center>Me with my favorite edition of Felus cattus, Caddish</img_txt><p> Over time, a population of this African wildcat slowly evolved into the ones we love and cherish today, <i> Felis cattus</i>. The development of <i>Felis catus</i> exhibits the widespread utility and compassion that humans have for these creatures. As protectors of the grainaries, venerated goddesses of fertility, and lovable yet independent partner, cats have played an exceptional role in the development of culture and psychology.
