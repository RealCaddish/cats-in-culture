        "Description": "Welcome, fellow cat enthusiast! Prepare yourself for a journey to the past as we explore how our favorite fluff evolved from a savage hunter on the plains of Africa into our charming and beloved household lap-lounger. The domestic housecat, known as Felis catus, exhibits a complex and gradual history of evolution quite distinct from other domesticated animals. If you’ve ever heard the phrase, “like taming a herd of cats,” you’ll recognize the irony in the idea that cats can somehow bend to our will—unlike the nature of other ‘domestic’ animals such as dogs, sheep, or goats. People are often confused about whether cats truly are ‘domestic’ or ‘tame.’ <img src=images/catDrawing.jpg alt=Cat Drawing; style=width:50% height:50%> <br><img_txt> Drawing from the <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=cat+drawing&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image> Wikimedia Commons</a></img_txt> <br>   This distinction is an important one that will be a central theme throughout our historical journey. If a young ‘wild’ species of any animal is captured at a young age, humans retain the ability to give care and therefore ‘tame’ it into a mostly-trusted, modified companion. A ‘domestic’ animal, in contrast, is one in which genetic change has occurred over time throughout an entire population as humans artificially selected individuals to be more tolerant and adapted to living with them. \n    Felis catus is no exception to this process. However, because cats often put on airs of superiority and possess a natural self-aggrandizing attitude, we’re often confused if we control the cat or if the cat controls us. Who is domesticating who? Is this animal tame or domesticated? To answer these questions more fully, let’s take a journey back in time to Felis catus’ verified wild progenitor, the African wildcat (Felis lybica). \n",

        "Description": "Our journey begins with the verified precursor species of Felis catus known as Felis lybica, also known as the African wildcat. Controversial taxonomic literature about the precise ancestral progenitor to Felis catus perplexed geneticists for decades. However, in 2007, a  team of genetic researchers published a highly-praised genetic assessment of 979 domestic and wild cats in a September issue of the journal, Science. Their analysis revealed that domestic cats from Europe, the Near East, and Asia, all derive from one of two genetic subtypes of Felis lybica—one from Turkey, the other from Egypt. <img src=images/felisLybica.jpg alt=Felis lybica style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> Photograph of an African wildcat (i.e. Felis lybica)</img_txt>  <br>Scholars are still unsure whether these populations became domesticated separately and later interbred, or if one became domesticated and later interbred with another population. Regardless, evidence of Felis catus’ ancestral lineage has been confirmed and we can readily trace its lineage across continents to Felis lybica. Let’s move on to a cultural history of this development from Felis lybica to Felis catus by means of humanity’s artificial selection. ",

        "Description": "The story of human involvement with the earliest felids begins in the Fertile Crescent, a region demarcated by modern countries spanning regions of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, and fringe areas of Turkey and Iran. The region of the Fertile Crescent is widely attributed to the earliest evidence of Neolithic farming settlements (circa 9,000 BCE) that began to dot the various river valleys such as the Tigris and Euphrates in the north, as well as a large portion of the Nile River valley to the south. Farmers in the Fertile Crescent particularly focused on cereals, legumes such as peas and lentils, as well as animal husbandry with sheep, pigs, goats, and cattle. \n\n     The region is often referred to as one of the ‘cradles of civilization,’ because a shift from mobile, hunter-gatherer societies to sedentary, agrarian ones became a defining mechanism of Homo sapiens’ earliest forms of societal and technological advancements. <img src=images/fertileCrescent.jpg alt=The Fertile Crescent Image style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> Illustration of the Fertile Crescent by Stefano Bianchetti in <a href=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/fertile-crescent/>National Geographic's Encyclopedia</a></img_txt> <br>  By the 3rd Millennium BCE, the advent of agriculture in the region brought about developments in irrigation, writing, the wheel, and glass, as well as new cultural phenomena such as libraries, forms of organized law, and construction activities. \n   Farmers soon realized that a positive aspect to their practice resulted in food surpluses. In short order, farmers constructed granaries to store their produce and they soon became a major characteristic of farming villages throughout the region.  \n\nAs farming reshaped Homo sapiens’ social behaviors and practices, so too did it reshape those of the local wildlife. As granaries were filled at the end of each harvest season, rodents and insects soon wrought havoc on the bounty. Fortunately, the farmers overseeing granaries soon realized that cats (particularly Felis lybica) were particularly useful in controlling these varmint and insect populations, and naturally participated in a mutually beneficial relationship. Here, we have the earliest forms of cat ‘taming’ in which local populations of Felis lybica lived alongside humans where they could enjoy tasty mammalian treats while humans rested easy knowing their granaries weren’t overrun with destructive and invasive species. \n",

        "Description": "Before we move any further in our journey, let’s take a moment to view this early dynamic between human and cat. It should be noted that this process was not particularly linear, and there are always exceptions to the archaeological record. Although the Fertile Crescent is an excellent starting point for examining this relationship, other, earlier examples of humans living alongside cats have been discovered in other regions in the world. Even though Cyprus is often ‘roped in’ to the region of the Fertile Crescent, there is no doubt among archaeologists that Felis lybica was intentionally brought to the island for practices outside of agriculture during the Neolithic period.

        "Description": "For our journey into the cat domestication world, it should be noted that the process of converting a wildcat into our favorite feline was not an abrupt or overnight affair. As peoples of the Fertile Crescent continued to enjoy the fruits of a commensal relationship with cats, ancient Egyptians were on their way to establishing the first truly domestic population of Felis catus.\nThe earliest written records and grand artworks of cats were born out of ancient Egypt. On many reliefs, cats appear to be hunting next to humans while others show them in various homes on tables or sitting underneath chairs. <img src=images/egyptianCat.jpg alt=Obsequieties of Egyptian Cat style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> The Obsequies of an Egyptian Cat by John Reinhard Weguelin (1888)</img_txt> <br> The accounts, from grand reliefs to felid figurines to mummified cats, speak to a well-established narrative of cats leaving the granaries and slowly moving into Egyptian homes. Naturally, the cat achieved a divine status in Egyptian culture and provides the earliest hard evidence of cats interacting with their human counterparts.\n Because the Egyptian record spans a massive 3,000 years of history, our discussion of the cat will be subdivided into the common periodization practice used to organize this rich history into digestible chunks. <img src=images/egyptianCat2.jpg alt=Second Egyptian Cat image style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> An illustration of Egypt from <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sphinx_Pyramids_Fennec_Drawing_1870.jpg> Wikimedia Commons</a></img_txt> <br> Particularly, we will look at the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms to trace the Egyptians’ relationship with cats. \n      However, it should be noted that cats were living symbiotically with humans well-before the Old Kingdom as noted by wildcat burials found in the Predynastic villages of Abydos, al-Badari, and Mostegga alongside human remains in the Nile River Valley. But the earliest historic evidence of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt during the Old Kingdom lends itself to the earliest forms of cultural appreciation for the cat as a domestic partner through various artworks and religious context. \n",

The cat deity, Mafdet, is the earliest known cat-headed deity from the Egyptian Pantheon and she is often found associated with the first Dynastic Ruler of the Old Kingdom, the Pharoah Den.

The reunification of Upper and Lower Egypt was brought about by Mentuhotep II who commanded armies in small campaigns throughout Nubia as well as a restoration of Egyptian power in the strategic Sinai Peninsula. Upon the reunification of Lower and Upper Egypt, Mentuhotep II restored the cult of the ruler which made him a god during his lifetime.  \n Rulers during the Middle Kingdom were interested in a return to grand artworks that was lost during the First Intermediate Period between the Old and Middle Kingdoms. <img src=images/mentuhotepii.jpg alt=Pharaoh Mentuhotep ii style=width:90% height:80%> <br><img_txt> Mentuhotep II is credited with ushering in the Middle Kingdom due to his achievements in reunifying both Lower and Upper Egypt</img_txt> <br> Much of the artworks during the Middle Kingdom placed heavy emphasis on Memphite styles that were prominent during the Fifth and Early Sixth Dynasties. <br> <img src=images/middleKingdomPyramid.jpg alt=Middle Kingdom Pyramid style=width:80% height:80%> <img_txt> <br> The pyramids above are representative of the Middle Kingdom's change in architectural design choices.</img_txt> <br> Much nostalgia is palpable in the artworks where political ideologies from the Old Kingdom were revitalized.

        "Description": "Considered the most prosperous time of power in ancient Egypt, the New Kingdom was characterized by major territorial expansion and some of the most famous Pharaonic rulers we recognize today (i.e. Tutankhamun, Thutmose, Amenhotep III). By the 15th c. BCE, successful Egyptian military campaigns against the Nubians in the south and Hittites in the Near East in modern-day Syria allowed for New Kingdom Pharaohs to enjoy widespread territorial acquisition. This expansion of the New Kingdom Period also resulted in widespread trade practices that the Pharaohs initiated. For example, Hatshepsut began mercantile efforts between Egypt and the land of Punt which also contributed to the New Kingdom’s widespread success. \n    <img src=images/mafdet2.jpg alt= Image of Mafdet fragments style=width:80% height:80%> <br><img_txt> Above is an image of two fragments of a relief depicting Mafdet as the Mistress of Hut Ankh</img_txt> <br> Certain Egyptian deities also gained popularity during the New Kingdom Period. The ancient goddess Bastet, who was worshiped as early as the Second Dynasty during the Old Kingdom Period, attained greater popularity, and was worshiped in Lower Egypt at the city of Bubastis. Bastet was considered the goddess of protection, cats, perfume, fertility, and warfare to name a few. Much like Mafdet, Bastet was popular for her cat-like nature and ability to protect the peoples of Lower Egypt. By the end of the New Kingdom Period, the practice of killing cats was illegal and punishable by death. \n    The New Kingdom Period ended with the death of its last pharaoh, Rameses XI in 1070 BCE. As internal bickering among his offspring took effect, Egypt quickly transitioned into what became known as the Third Intermediate Period marked by economic and political decline in the Nile River Valley. The period coincides with the ‘Late Bronze Age collapse,’ which fueled debates among scholars about how and why the Bronze Age terminated so rapidly. <img src=images/bastet.jpg alt= Image of Bastet style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> Above is a relief of the Goddess Bastet. She gained notoriety during the New Kingdom and is credited with being a goddess of fertility and protection against diseases and evil spirits </img_txt> <br>  Upon Rameses XI’s death, Upper and Lower Egypt again split between de facto rulers, the High Priests of Amun in Thebes ruled the former, while Smendes took hegemony in the latter. By 525 BCE, Cambyses II of the Achaemenid Empire in the northeast conducted campaigns in Egypt which saw the end of native Egyptian rule in the area. With the changing of the political guard, so too did cats find themselves in new homes, cultures, and geographic locations out of Egypt. \n",

Alexander established a new dynasty of rulers in Egypt with his general Ptolemy I Soter who was also the Hellenistic diadochi in Macedon.\nThe Ptolemaic Dynasty established in Egypt brought forth a new period of foreign rule that the Nile Valley had never experienced before and came to be known as ‘Greco-Roman Egypt.’ The period is marked by heavy cultural and political exchange between the Greeks and Egypt and, naturally, cats were no exception. <img src=images/GreekCat380BCE.jpg alt= Cat in Greece Image style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> A photograph of the side of a Hellenistic pottery vessel showcasing a cat with its owner.

        "Description": "Although cats adjoined their ancient Egyptian counterparts in the Greek islands, the Semitic Phoenician civilization of the eastern Mediterranean was likely the primary engine bringing cats into the Greek world. A major characteristic of the Phoenicians was their extensive maritime trade network, making them a dominant mercantile power for much of the first millennium BCE. After the dissolution of native Egyptian hegemony from the end of the Bronze Age collapse, Phoenicians seem to have weathered the political storm fairly well. From an archaeological perspective, no major disruptions in trade or exchange are present. \nBy the fifth century BCE, Felis catus had made its way into mainland Greece and southern Italy most likely by trade practices with the Phoenician maritime merchants. Our earliest evidence of the Greeks with Felis catus comes from two coins depicting Iokasto and Phalanthos playing with their pet cats. \nEven though cats were being introduced to Greece and Italy at this time, they remained quite rare as house pets compared to the Egyptians. <br> <img src=images/Greekcatanddogfight.jpg_large alt= Greeks with their animals style=width:90% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> Above, the statue base from Athens depicts a dog and a feline about to fight (circa 510-500 BCE) <br> </img_txt> Weasels, not cats, were far more common as ‘rodent-regulators,’ and the lack of reverence for them in the Greek word ailouros (thing with the wavy tail) exemplifies as such. However, over time, weasels slowly fell out of favor in Greece as cats replaced them as more pleasant to enjoy in the house. Weasels seem to have not taken to domestication as well as cats did, and therefore, they were soon replaced by their felid friends. Regardless, the cat never achieved the sort of cultic appeal they had in Egypt and textual and artistic renderings of them remained sparse. \n",

        "Description": "Much like their Greek predecessors, ancient Romans also remained apathetic about the cat and its role in society and few artworks or literary pieces of the cat’s existence remain. The sparse data we do have about domestic cats from the period is typically overshadowed by Romans’ fascination with ‘big cats’ that were often killed for sport at the Roman Colosseum or for their elegant hides used for fashionable clothing. Nevertheless, cats and weasels remained primary rodent hunters around Roman granaries, but neither achieved the deified status the former enjoyed in Egypt. \nFrom a traditional Roman story about the dedication of the temple of the goddess Libertas at Mount Aventine, Tiberius Gracchus is said to have placed a cat at her feet. Libertas, wearing a white robe with a scepter in one hand and a Phrygian cap in the other, accepted the offering and the Temple was duly blessed. Libertas and the Phrygian cap are both symbolic of freedom and independence. The relationship between freedom and the Phrygian cap was a later construct created during the American and French Revolutions. The original <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(hat)> pileus</a> is thought to have originated by the ancient Illyrians but regardless, was quite popular at the time. <br><img src=images/pileus.jpg alt= Pileus cap style=width:50% height:50%> <br> <img_txt> Above, a man sports a pileus which was popular among  ancient Greeks and Romans.<br> </img_txt>    Traditionally, a velvet pileus was worn by liberated Roman slaves and, as such, the cat at the feet of Libertas signified this freedom. \nDespite this literary evidence, cats were perhaps less popular in Rome than their Greek predecessors. Felis catus’ character traits of disobedience, individualism, and disloyalty were not necessarily the same traits admired by Roman citizens. Additionally, domestic cats were not nearly as glorious, mighty, or heroic as other animals that Romans admired and chose to depict in their artworks and literature. <br><img src=images/catinRome.jpg alt= Cat mosaic from Rome style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> A mosaic of a cat confidently catching a bird<br> </img_txt>Romans later honored the cat, however, with the phrase “Libertas sine Labore” which translates as “Liberty without labor,” a description of how cats achieved freedom by doing nothing at all.

A light-green cat running while looking behind itself became an emblem often put on Roman infantrymen’s shields. Cats were also accompanying many Roman legions to battle and funerary steles and sarcophagi from Roman Gaul often included artworks of cat images. Additionally, Vandals and Suevi in the northern Germanic tribes often carried cat hides that they used to cover shields and armor for protection from the sun. \nBy the 6th century CE, Romans had largely changed their opinion of the cat and began seeing them as virtuous for their courage and cunning attitudes. <img src=images/romanshield.jpg alt= Only surviving Roman shield style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> The only surviving Roman shield in existence.

        "Description": "By 380 CE, Christianity went from a cultic house-church society to the official religion of Rome. Theodosius I first uttered: <br><i> \nIt is our will….that none of our subjects, whether magistrates or private citizen…shall worship an inanimate idol by the sacrificing of a guiltless victim. The rites of pagan superstition, which might seem less bloody and atrocious are abolished, as highly injurious, to the truth and honor of religion… garlands, frankincense, and libation of wine are especially enumerated and condemned; the harmless claims of the domestic genius of the household gods, are included in the rigorous prescription.\n <br></i>Even though a hefty fine was levied on those practicing the old religion, Pagans continued to worship their god in secret. The continued popularity of Paganism was not lost on Theodosius I. <img src=images/pagansInRome.jpg alt= pagans in Rome style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> The term pagan is derived from paganus, a Latin word which means 'civilian' or one who was not associated with the honor of the emperor. The term was used to label those who didn't serve the 'true' emperor, Christ, and thus, they were considered outsiders. </img_txt> <br> To combat the continued veneration of the old Pagan gods, Theodosius I instituted two things that would quickly bring punishment upon detractors. First, if a judge didn’t prosecute a religious crime, he would be deemed guilty of the heresy as well. Secondly, idolatry practiced by Pagans including veneration of foreign gods, such as Egyptian Isis in Rome, often included practices of cat-worship. For Theodosius I, any worship practices involved with cats would be ample evidence of heresy and therefore result in persecution. \n",

By 476 CE, Romulus Augustus abdicated the Roman seat of power to Odoacer, a Germanic Goth who quickly took power in Rome. For over 500 years, the Greco-Roman political and cultural systems had grown to accept the cat as part of their daily lives. <img src=images/abdication.jpg alt= Abdication of Romulus Augustus style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> A 19-th century illustration of the abdication of Romulus Augustus to the barbarian, Odoacer.

Two major events would bring this practice and the wider acceptance of cats in the Roman Empire to a close. First, as mentioned earlier, Christianity’s inception as the official religion of Rome resulted in new rules that made heresy illegal, including the worship of cats. Second, the utter downfall of Rome as the seat of Western power quickly brought new political and cultural shifts to the forefront. Cats were no exception to this and, soon, the Dark Ages of Europe brought new distrust and disdain to our feline friend from Egypt. ",

        "Description": "The dissolution of the Roman Empire by the Goths was one aspect of incredible geopolitical changes taking place in Europe and North Africa. Although Christianity was dominating Paganism by this time, the rise of Islam created a power competition spanning central Asia to western Europe. The continued demonization of Pagan goddesses brought with it a distrust of cats as well. \n     A fundamental theological difference between Pagans and Christians influenced this attitude towards cats. According to the Pagan theology, all creatures had spirits or what we commonly today consider souls. During the Dark Ages, the common Christian belief, on the other hand, was that these souls were evil or devoid of God. This created the foundational difference between the opposing belief systems (i.e. monotheism vs. polytheism, nature vs. man, man vs. woman). <img src= images/catsandblackdeath.jpg alt= Cats in Black Death style=width:80% height:80%> <br> <img_txt> Cats removing rats and bird. <br> </img_txt>  \n     As this religious competition permeated throughout the geopolitical landscape, the Plague of Justinian brought death and increased distrust among Christians towards Pagans. Scholars estimate that roughly 5,000 people died per day between 541 – 547 CE, resulting in close to 60% of the total European population. As the Plague of Justinian wrought havoc on the population, Christians soon tied Pagans to God’s anger and, with them, cats as culprits too. The nature goddesses of Isis, Diana, Freya, and Artemis, were just a handful of pagan cults deemed heretical by the organized Christian church. Cats, were therefore quickly linked to their heretical followers and were demonized by the Christian church in short order. The rise of early Christianity was inextricably linked to the confirmation of a patriarchal society, valuing dominance, and hunter psychologies over matriarchal societies that valued goddesses associated with farming, fertility, and independence. <img src=images/catsMiddleAges.jpg alt= Cat in Middle Ages style=width:80% height:80%> <br> The patriarchy of the established church brought with it submissive attitudes and roles towards women as well as a continued campaign against all non-conforming to Church doctrine as heresies. This shift in religious and cultural psychology paved the way for cats to be demonized in much of Christian Europe during the Dark Ages. \n    Regardless, cats still dotted the Christian landscape. For instance, Pope Gregory was described as always having a cat in his lap and, by 640 CE, St. Gertrude of Nivelles was known for her love of cats too. As plagues became commonplace among Europe, vermin were slowly beginning to be recognized as the culprit of disease that wrought havoc on European societies and cats were a perfect solution to the problem. Slowly, cats were becoming disassociated with the Pagan cults that were so inextricably linked to them and began to prance their way into the care of Christian households. \n",

        "Description": "The cultural, economic, and scientific flourishment of Islam during this period is said to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid in 786 CE and the inauguration of the House of Wisdom or Grand Library in Baghdad. Muslims during this period showed a marked interest in incorporating scientific knowledge, literature, and art into the civilizations they had conquered. The Golden Age of Islam also saw newfound technologies that played a major role in the achievements of the period.\n An easier writing system through the introduction of paper made information much more democratized than it had been to that point in time. Manufacturing parchment also had many positives over the traditional medium of papyrus. One positive included parchment’s ability to absorb ink, unlike papyrus, which would enable the keeping of permanent, difficult-to-erase records. Additionally, the Golden Age of Islam witnessed major breakthroughs in branches of mathematics, including Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, and Trigonometry, to name a few. Other developments in astronomy, physics, chemistry, philosophy, and architecture brought newfound developments in its societies.  \nAs forms of organized Islam began to take shape in the Near East and Europe, a more compassionate attitude towards cats was prevalent in their societies in contrast to their Christian counterparts. The Quran is much kinder towards cats as many stories about them and the Prophet Muhammad are found throughout the text. In one story, Muhammad passes his hand over his favorite cat, Muezza, three times to give all tabby cats their stripes and ability to land on their feet. Cats in Islamic tradition are often admired for their cleanliness and are thus allowed to enter homes and mosques without any washing of the feet or— for that matter—paws. \n",

        "Description": "By the 8th c. CE, cats not only came to dominate much of the European landscape, but were well on their way to Central and Eastern Asia. The Silk Road no doubt saw merchant traders bringing their cats with them on journeys across the divide and they likely found themselves in homes and traded among locals close to the trade route. By the 8th c. CE, artworks of cats in India were being made such as the stone carving at Mahabalipuram. Cats in India had varying cultural affinities and disdains. One latter example comes from a fable known as The Devout Cat, a story about a partridge and a hare who seek wisdom from a local cat about a dispute between the two. The cat routinely claims he cannot hear them and asks them to come closer. Over time, the distrust of the partridge and hare is met with fading wariness, and they approach the cat in hopes of receiving advice. To their dismay, the cat attacks both of them and the cat is therefore considered clever, Machiavellian, and evil. \n Another negative affiliation with cats comes from Buddhism. In old age, the Buddha had eaten food thought to have been undercooked or spoiled. A mouse is sent out of Kushinagar to retrieve medicine for the ailing Buddha, only to be caught by a cat. The Buddha subsequently dies, and the unrepentant cat does not mourn his passing. \n   These negative associations with cats in India speak to distrust of them throughout India. \n",

        "Description": "By the turn of the first millennium CE, religious and political turmoil beset much of Western Europe as the persecution of non-Christians, Jews, and Muslims became common practice by the central Catholic authority. As Christianization of Europe became a political mission for the Catholic Church, the Black Death between 1347 and 1352 wrought one of the deadliest pandemics that the continent had ever recorded. Scholars estimate that somewhere between 75 to 200 million people died from the disease in Eurasia and North Africa. Both historical events brought forth new, far more potent attitudes about cats, heresy, and witchcraft.\nThe authority gained by Christianity during the Middle Ages, as well as the onslaught brought about by the Black Death, gave rise to accusations of witchcraft with a newfound connection to the cat. Perhaps old attitudes of cats affiliated with the Pagan gods had not wholly worn off. As the Catholic Church became the primary civil and criminal court body, witchcraft and magic was well on its way to being identified and codified in order to find and persecute detractors.\nOpinions of cats during the Middle Ages went from gentle to harsh as people desperately attempted to explain the worsening situation in Europe at the time. By 1096, cats were still seen as granary protectors and treated with fairness. In fact, Henry I of England declared laws protecting cats, including one punishing a cat-killer with a fine of 60 bushels of corn. Despite these laws, it was not uncommon to find cat furs, cat linings, cat gloves, and other cat raiments - as popular clothing items in the region. Regardless, a common misconception is that peoples of the Middle Ages killed cats en masse. Although cats were becoming associated with the devil (see the Taigheirm for the most explicit example) and there were certainly people killing cats occasionally, no evidence exists that the Catholic Church conducted mass feline executions. It is likely that the utility of cats at the granaries outweighed the idea that cats were the culprits of the Black Death. \n",

        "Description": "As the Black Death slowly came to a close, cats were becoming more and more inextricably linked to Satan, devil-worship, and witchcraft. Things took a turn for the worse in 1484 when Dominican inquisitors informed Pope Innocent VIII that witchcraft was rampant in Germany. In response, Pope Innocent VIII’s decree, Papal Bull Summis Desiderantes Affectibus stated both witches and cats were to be burned at the stake. Three years later, the Malleus Maleficarum was published, explaining how a) women were more likely than men to be witches, b) how to conduct investigations into witchcraft, and c) how to legally proceed with the courts to try these cases. \nDistrust of women became commonplace in the Church, primarily due to an interpretation of the Biblical Genesis story suggesting women were defective because they were created from Adam’s rib as well as causing the ‘temptation of man.’ Other Biblical passages also fueled these anti-women viewpoints, and the Catholic church was quick to link them and their cats to heresy. Clearly, men within the church feared women throughout the Middle Ages as heretical detractors; edicts from the Pope as well as publications issued from the Catholic Church provide a window into this viewpoint. \nThe link between cats and magic was nothing new by 1272 CE. Evidence of cats related to magic has been found as early as the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. Black cats were considered important because their blood mixed with particular herbs was believed to be extremely effective in warding off disease, as well as casting powerful incantations. \nBy the end of the Middle Ages, corrupt women and cats had fallen from graced goddesses to be celebrated into feared symbols of magic, heresy, and devil-worship. However, these cultural attitudes would once again change—but the cat would never again achieve the goddess worship it once enjoyed. \n",
