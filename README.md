# cats-in-culture

***What?***

I’m creating a map that traces the history of domestic cats over time. By looking at the earliest examples of cats living alongside humans to their introduction to the Americas, I hope to paint a cultural portrait of the domestication process as well as the cultural affinities and attitudes towards cats over time. By tracing the domestic cat through Cyprus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, and Eurasia, I hope to create an interesting story map that showcases various points in history and how they intersect with attitudes towards cats. I’m planning to utilize a UI slider that can be moved forward and backward to trace these periods over time as well as points on a map that show various archaeological sites where cats are found or created via artwork. 

***Where?*** 

My project will span the globe. Starting in Cyprus during the Neolithic Period, I plan to show how cats became domesticated over time and explain to the user their significance in various cultures as well as how these cultural attitudes changed over time due to the course of history. As the user clicks forward, a new time period will be explained as well as a pan of the map to the general location being mapped. 

***When?***


The map spans general ‘periods of interest’ when major historical events took place that influenced the movement of the domestic cat into expanding territory out of the ancient Near East. From the Neolithic Period to the Egyptian Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms, as well as the Hellenistic, Roman, Islamic, Dark Ages, Middle Ages, and the Columbian Exchange in the pre-modern period, the user will gain a general understanding of these various points in history by means of the domestic cat.
